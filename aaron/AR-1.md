# Goals

A protocol for NFT/Digital Art has two features:
1. A Digital Art is more than a simple JPEG/MP3 and which should be played by an specific web app or software, we need to design a pattern which tells users how to display the digital art correctly.
2. The digital art on the blockchain should have markup language which support the information exchanging between the art works and chain information. 

## Introduction

A digital Art is an new type art works in the so-called web3 time, and most of nft/digital art stills use media format such as JPEG/MP3 to store and display which may violate the intention from its creator and some privacy rules. It is necessary to provide the information about which player to use and other fields like identifiers and vertification data. The aaron protocol defines an universal scheme of digital art and it is designed to sovle the problems above. 

For example, The JPEG format photo display software is default `preview` in the mac os, and it couldn't commnunicate with the web3 infrastructure because `preview` wasn't developed for showing a web3 digital art. A developer called Aaron wants to develop an player could shows markup <owner.name>, the markup <owner.name> is a information on the chain which means the digtal art work owner's nickname . One simple solution is to modify the suffix to an new symbol such as ".jpeg3", but it would break the compatibility for browersers and users who don't have player support `.jpeg3`. We should also provide the way to solve problem during the compatibility.

## Design Goals

## Uniform Player Identifier

The UPI(Uniform Player Identifier) is as follows:

> {Player Locator}://{Format Name}/{Perseved Fields}?{Parameter}

> eth.dao.web3player://jpeg?chainid=137&rpcurl=https://polygon-rpc.com/

### Player Locator

Companies use their reversed Internet domain name to begin their package namesâ€”for example, com.example.myplayer for a player named myplayer created by a programmer at example.com.

Name collisions that occur within a single company need to be handled by convention within that company, perhaps by including the region or the project name after the company name (for example, com.example.region.mypackage).

### Compatibility

The Uniform Player Identifier could be stored in the annotation, the following chart would show the place:

|  Format   | location  |
|  ----  | ----  |
| JPEG  | in the 0xFFFE comment |
| PNG  |  |
| MP3  | |
